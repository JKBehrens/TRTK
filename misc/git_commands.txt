Create a new feature branch
---------------------------

Feature branches should be created if you want to implement a
complete new feature or need to make bigger code changes. Always
try to keep the development branch to remain fully functional.
In general you should branch off from the 'develop' branch.

git checkout -b feature/myfeature develop



Merge the new feature branch with 'develop'
-------------------------------------------

New features may/should only be merged if they are fully
functional and if appropriate unit tests have been written.

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/myfeature
git branch -d feature/myfeature
git push origin develop



Merge the new development branch with master
--------------------------------------------

git checkout master
git merge --no-ff develop
git tag -a v0.16.1 -m 'Merged feature XXX'      # or just -m 'Version 0.16.1'
git push --follow-tags origin master
