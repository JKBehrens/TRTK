Roadmap
=======


Version 1
---------

- should be reached soon
- simplified interfaces
    - container interface via Range<T> (see e.g. PivotCalibration)
- harmonized function names (RMSE vs. RMS) [the former is better...]
- add some litte more missing functionality
    - e.g. something like Line line(...); double distance = line.distanceTo(Plane(...));
- note, until version 1 is reached the minor version number is changed with any non-compatible API change
    
Version 2 (or higher)
---------------------

- get rid of most of the template code
    - use double as default number type
    - thus faster compile cycles
- replace Coordinate<T> with three simpler classes (Point2D, Point3D, and Point4D)
- avoid Eigen classes in public interfaces (maybe apart from Matrix3d and Matrix4d)
- update of the doxygen engine (aim: no warnings anymore)
- usage of C++14 features
